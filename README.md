<h1>Agent town</h1>

<h2>The project</h2>
The project is an attempt to create a modular network supporting distributed constraint optimization problems research and devleopment.

<h2>The Idea</h2>
The world of computer science have gone through many iterations in the past. First Computers were big and expensive thus computing was centralizied,
and it was done mainly in universites and large corporations.
After that a new era of personal computers has begun as computers became cheaper and more viable. Then the birth of the Internet gave rise to 
centralized servers. Finally we arive at today to the age of microservices and distributed computing. 
The flactuation between centralized and distributed computing never stops. Each new iteration brings new challanges and advantages.

In this project the focus is to create an infrastructure for solving distributed constraint optimization problems(DCOPs). 
Both for research and for the development of a real-world application for that type of computation.
More on the subject of DCOPs can be found on this [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_constraint_optimization)

<h3>DSA</h3>
To demonstrate the problems this project aims to solve and one approach to sloving them i've decided to record the following introduction
that focuses on an algortihm called: 'Distributed stochastic algorithm' or DSA.
In the video below i am explaining DSA and concepts in distributed calculation.

<h2>The goal</h2>

The goal is to create a central server that can be setup to monitor traffic within the network, collect data, display progress, and simulate an environment 
that is as close to real life scenarios as possible.

Clients simulating a single or a collection of agents operating independantly must be implemented to allow them to run algorithms that can solve DCOPs.
